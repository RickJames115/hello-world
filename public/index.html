            <h5>Hello World! It's me Rick James!</h5>

            <p>
                The web to me is something amazing. To be able to share information from all around the world changed my life forever.
                I remember setting up AOL homepage at the age of 10 feeling like I was somekind of graphic artist.
                We were all on AOL chat rooms that is where it all started for me. there were chat rooms for every subject you can think of.
                My spelling and vocabulary improved more in 1 month than a whole year in english class.
            </p>

                Now people can sit at home and make video's and post them for everyone to see, instead of just text.
                After so many views, companies want to put their adds on your page and pay you money. Thats a big game changer.
                More and more opertunities are possible for people to do what they love and make great money because of the internet.
