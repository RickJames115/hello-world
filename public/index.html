          <p>hello, text story of the web</p>

          <p>The web to me is something amazing. To be able to share information from all around the world changed my life forever.  I remember setting up AOL homepage at the age of 10 feeling like I was somekind of graphic artist.  We were all on AOL chat rooms thats is where it all started for me. </p>
